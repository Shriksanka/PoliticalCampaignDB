# PoliticalCampaignDB

Welcome to the PoliticalCampaignDB repository. This repository contains a logical model diagram that outlines the structure of a database tailored for managing the data needs of a political campaign.

## File

- `DB_Valerii_Andriushchenko_HW_Political-Campaign_diagram_upd.png` - This file is a comprehensive Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that represents the logical model of the political campaign database. The diagram illustrates tables, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

## Description of the Diagram

The ERD serves as a blueprint for developers, database administrators, and campaign analysts who are tasked with implementing a database solution for a political campaign. It includes entities such as voters, surveys, contributions, events, and volunteers, each connected in a way that represents the complex interactions within a political campaign.

### Diagram Features

- **Entity Tables**: Each entity such as `voter`, `donor`, `survey`, `finance`, etc., is shown with detailed attributes.
- **Keys**: Primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) are indicated to identify the unique records and relationships.
- **Relationships**: The diagram details the relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many, with corresponding relationship lines.
- **Constraints and Rules**: Information about the constraints like `NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and `DEFAULT` values are included. There are also notes on certain business rules and checks.

## How to Use the Diagram

- To create the database, each rectangle (representing a database table) should be translated into a SQL table creation statement with the corresponding attributes and data types.
- The lines with crows feet, arrows, and other symbols represent the cardinality and nature of relationships that must be enforced through foreign key constraints in the actual database.
- The notes within the diagram provide additional business logic that should be incorporated either at the database level (e.g., through constraints) or in the application logic.

## Contribution

If you identify potential improvements or any issues with the logical model, please raise an issue in the repository. As this is a reference model, direct contributions to the diagram may not be applicable, but discussions and suggestions are welcome.
